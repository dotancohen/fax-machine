Simple web application that sends and recieves faxes.  Uses Django/Gunicorn/Nginx, Twilio, SendGrid, and Firebase under the hood.  Built for Raspbian, but can easily be made to run on any other OS with minor tweaks.  I challenged myself to make operating this as dirt-cheap as possible, leveraging free tiers where ever possible.
